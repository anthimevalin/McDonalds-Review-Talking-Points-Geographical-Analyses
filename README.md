# McDonalds-Review-Talking-Points-Geographical-Analyses
The aim of this notebook is using the McDonaldâ€™s customer review dataset to outline the main talking points of the reviews at each rating and to explore the geographical location of McDonald branches in regards to customer sentiment.
In the first section of the notebook, the main talking points of the reviews were vectorized using TF-IDF and were clustered using KMeans (with varying cluster sizes), and then word clouds of the clusters were produced. In the second section, the geographical location of the stores and their average rating were displayed on a heatmap and cartopy. If you enjoy/find this helpful make sure to give me an upvote, and any feedback and criticism is also welcomed !
